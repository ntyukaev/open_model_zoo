# Text-to-speech Python\* Demo {#omz_demos_python_demos_text_to_speech_demo_README}

## Description
The text to speech demo show how to run the ForwardTacotron and WaveRNN models to produce an audio file for a given input text file.
The demo is based on https://github.com/as-ideas/ForwardTacotron and https://github.com/fatchord/WaveRNN repositories.

## How It Works

Upon the start-up, the demo application reads command-line parameters and loads four networks to the
Inference Engine plugin. The demo pipeline reads text file by lines and divides every line to parts by punctuation marks.
The heuristic algorithm chooses punctuation near to the some threshold by sentence length.
When inference is done, the application outputs the audio to the WAV file with 22050 Hz sample rate.

## Running

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:

```
usage: text_to_speech_demo.py [-h] -m_duration MODEL_DURATION -m_forward
                              MODEL_FORWARD -m_upsample MODEL_UPSAMPLE -m_rnn
                              MODEL_RNN -i INPUT [-o OUT]
                              [--upsampler_width UPSAMPLER_WIDTH] [-d DEVICE]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -m_duration MODEL_DURATION, --model_duration MODEL_DURATION
                        Required. Path to ForwardTacotron`s duration
                        prediction part (*.xml format).
  -m_forward MODEL_FORWARD, --model_forward MODEL_FORWARD
                        Required. Path to ForwardTacotron`s mel-spectrogram
                        regression part (*.xml format).
  -m_upsample MODEL_UPSAMPLE, --model_upsample MODEL_UPSAMPLE
                        Required. Path to WaveRNN`s part for mel-spectrogram
                        upsampling by time axis (*.xml format).
  -m_rnn MODEL_RNN, --model_rnn MODEL_RNN
                        Required. Path to WaveRNN`s part for waveform
                        autoregression (*.xml format).
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Text file with text.
  -o OUT, --out OUT     Required. Path to an output .wav file
  --upsampler_width UPSAMPLER_WIDTH
                        Width for reshaping of the model_upsample. If -1 then
                        no reshape. Do not use with FP16 model.
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        Optional. Specify the target device to infer on; CPU,
                        GPU, FPGA, HDDL, MYRIAD or HETERO: is acceptable. The
                        sample will look for a suitable plugin for device
                        specified. Default value is CPU
```

Running the application with the empty list of options yields the usage message and an error message.

## Example for running with arguments
```
python3 text_to_speech_demo.py --model_upsample wavernn_upsampler.xml --model_rnn wavernn_rnn.xml --model_duration forward_tacotron_duration_prediction.xml --model_forward forward_tacotron_regression.xml --input <path_to_file_with_text.txt>
```

To run the demo, you can use public pre-trained models. You can download the pre-trained models with the OpenVINO
[Model Downloader](../../../tools/downloader/README.md).

> **NOTE**: Before running the demo with a trained model, make sure the model is converted to the Inference Engine
format (\*.xml + \*.bin) using the
[Model Optimizer tool](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html).

## Demo Output

The application outputs is WAV file with generated audio.
