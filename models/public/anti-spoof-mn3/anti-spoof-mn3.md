# anti-spoof-mn3 {#omz_models_public_anti_spoof_mn3_anti_spoof_mn3}

## Use Case and High-Level Description

The `anti-spoof-mn3` model is an anti-spoofing binary classificator based on the [MobileNetv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244), trained on the [CelebA-Spoof dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12342). It's a small, light model, trained to predict whether or not a spoof RGB image given to the input. A lot of advanced techniques have been tried and selected the best suit options for the task.
